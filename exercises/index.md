## INSTRUCTIONS

Playing is simple, just follow the instructions. The underscore is where your cursor should be(by default, it will usually be at the start of the puzzle, but will also sometimes appear in the middle or at the end). There are many ways to do the instructions, but the challenge is to do it in as few keystrokes as possible.

## GUIDELINES

 - The maximum number of moves is just a guideline. You can go way past that(means you need more practice), or you can use half the number of moves(you can send me your solution so I can lower the guideline - with credits to you of course).

 - ANY keystroke is counted. If you need to type `hello`, the count breakdown would be:
   - **1** for the insert **i**
   - **5** for the letters **hello**

   For a grand total of 6 keystrokes.

 - Don't count `ESC` if it is the last keystroke. From the example above, no need to count `ESC` as the last keystroke.
 - Pressing `SHIFT` + any key counts as one, not two. If you use `:`, that counts as one keystroke, and not two(`SHIFT` + `;`)

 - Try to count out loud as you type and double check your count, but don't obsess on it.

 - Remember to only use PLAIN Vim commands. No using plugins like surround, etc.

 - **Have fun!**
