Vim-puzzles are short text puzzles that only require a basic knowledge of the text editor, Vim. To be able to get better 'scores', you'll have to study the more advanced movements in Vim.

The aim of this is to test your Vim knowledge and to allow beginners to practice their skills. Some of the sets will be common occurances in a programmer's daily life while others are just there to test how much you can optimize your Vim skills.

Playing is simple, just follow the instructions. The underscore is where your cursor should be(it will usually be at the start of the puzzle, but will also sometimes appear in the middle or at the end). There are many ways to do the instructions, but the challenge is to do it in as few keystrokes as possible.
