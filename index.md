## ABOUT

Vim-puzzles are short text puzzles that only require a basic knowledge of the text editor, Vim. This is made for beginner to advanced Vim users. While I have still a lot to learn, I hope that this is a good starting point for beginners to learn more advanced stuff.

## GOAL

The aim of this is to test your Vim knowledge and to allow beginners to practice their skills. Some of the sets will be common occurances in a programmer's daily life while others are just there to test how much you can optimize your Vim skills.

## CONTRIBUTE

 - Create your own exercises(I usually come up with exercises while coding them - like the refactoring and block exercises)
 - Just follow the format of adding the **stroke_count** and a descriptive/catchy/misleading title then the instructions.
 - Create pull request and share the Vim love
