## ABOUT

Vim-puzzles are short text puzzles that only require a basic knowledge of the text editor, Vim. This is made for beginner to advanced Vim users. While I still have a lot to learn, I hope that this is a good starting point for beginners to learn more advanced stuff.

## GOAL

The aim of this is to test your Vim knowledge and to allow beginners to practice their skills. Some of these exercises are common--you would have encountered them already. Some were designed to test how much more you can optimize your Vim skills.
